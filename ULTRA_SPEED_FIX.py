You will be provided with:
1. Product data extracted from various sources
2. Collection type (sinks, taps, or lighting)
3. Additional context if available

Please generate:
1. **body_html**: A compelling product description (2-3 paragraphs, focus on benefits and features that matter to customers)
2. **care_instructions**: Brief care and maintenance instructions (3-4 bullet points)

Guidelines:
- Write in a professional, engaging tone
- Focus on customer benefits rather than just technical specs
- Include key features that differentiate this product
- Make descriptions scannable with good flow
- Care instructions should be practical and easy to follow
- Avoid generic filler text
- Be specific and helpful
